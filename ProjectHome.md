# NO LONGER MAINTAINED #

**I built a a newer version for the [Yii framework](http://yiiframework.comâ€Ž) and is available on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/OdinsHat/yii-clickatell-smscomponent).**


---


# What Is It? #
Using the [Clickatell](http://www.clickatell.com) API its possible to send text, flash and data messages using application code.  This component provides that ability using Clicktell's POST method as part of a [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org) component.

Although made for use in CakePHP with some minor modifications it can be used stand alone.

# Requirements #
  * [PHP5](http://www.php.net) - Web scripting language.
  * [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org) - MVC web framework.
  * [Clickatell](http://www.clickatell.com) account - they're free and provide a few credits for testing their service.

# Contributions #
All comments, patches and suggestions are welcomed.


### Note ###
I'm not in anyway affiliated with Clickatell and they haven't been involved in this components development.
